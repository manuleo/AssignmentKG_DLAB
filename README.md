Repo to work on the Assignment for the DLAB for the Semester Project

# To create the Report:
Run the script `convert.sh` (first you need to give to it permissions to run, using `chmod +x convert.sh` on a Linux/Mac machine), then simply run the program using the command:

```
./convert.sh notebook_name.ipynb format output_file
```

The format can be `pdf`, `latex`, and the output file should respect the format selected.
